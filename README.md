## Project summary

PreTHOD is a data analysis project at the [St. Hedwig university
hospital of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin
Berlin](https://psychiatrie-psychotherapie.charite.de/fuer_patienten/charite_im_shk/ "Link to hospital web-site")
that tries to identify prognostic factors for the treatment outcome of
depression by analyzing a dataset from routine clinical practice. The
data were collected with tablet-based standardized self-rating tools
both in the day clinic as well as the specialized ward for depression.
Both settings work with the same cognitive-behavioral therapy program
that consists of group and single therapeutic sessions as well as
complementary therapies.

## Data and Code Management

### Project folder structure

**Comment:** This repository aspires to meet the principles of a
[research
compendium](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html?highlight=compendium "Research Compendia (The Turing way)").

- `markdown/figures` is for figures that are ready to be included in
  .Rmd reports
- `output/plots` take all other graphics, e.g. large PDF files with
  plots on multiple pages
- `src` home of the main R scripts

### Transparency statement on usage of AI tools

We would like to transparently report the use of
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), a large language model trained by
OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, for guiding the planning of
our research project, as well as for providing code completion
suggestions during data analysis in R. Additionally, we utilized
[perplexity.ai](perplexity.ai), an AI-powered tool, for literature
research and brainstorming. These tools were used in combination with
our own expertise and knowledge to enhance the quality and efficiency of
our work.
