## Project summary

PreTHOD is a data analysis project at the [St. Hedwig university hospital of the Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin](https://psychiatrie-psychotherapie.charite.de/fuer_patienten/charite_im_shk/ "Link to hospital web-site") that tries to identify prognostic factors for the treatment outcome of depression by analyzing a dataset from routine clinical practice. The data were collected with tablet-based standardized self-rating tools both in the day clinic as well as the specialized ward for depression. Both settings work with the same cognitive-behavioral therapy program that consists of group and single therapeutic sessions as well as complementary therapies.

### Project folder structure

**Comment:** This folder structure is slowly evolving towards a structure that can be used as a template for a [research compendium](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html?highlight=compendium "Research Compendia (The Turing way)").

-   `markdown/figures` is for figures that are ready to be included in .Rmd reports
-   `output/plots` take all other graphics, e.g.¬†large PDF files with plots on multiple pages
-   `src` home of the main R scripts
