## Project summary {#project-summary}

PreTHOD is a data analysis project at the [St. Hedwig university hospital of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://psychiatrie-psychotherapie.charite.de/fuer_patienten/charite_im_shk/ "Link to hospital web-site") that tries to identify prognostic factors for the treatment outcome of depression by analyzing a dataset from routine clinical practice. The data were collected with tablet-based standardized self-rating tools both in the day clinic as well as the specialized ward for depression. Both settings work with the same cognitive-behavioral therapy program that consists of group and single therapeutic sessions as well as complementary therapies.

## Data and Code Management {#data-and-code-management}

### Project folder structure

This repository aspires to meet the principles of a [research compendium](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html?highlight=compendium "Research Compendia (The Turing way)").

-   `markdown/figures` is for figures that are ready to be included in .Rmd reports
-   `output/plots` take all other graphics, e.g. large PDF files with plots on multiple pages
-   `src` home of the main R scripts

```{r directory_tree, echo=FALSE}

### Transparency statement on usage of AI tools

We would like to transparently report the use of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, for guiding the planning of our research project, as well as for providing code completion suggestions during data analysis in R. Additionally, we utilized [perplexity.ai](perplexity.ai), an AI-powered tool, for literature research and brainstorming. These tools were used in combination with our own expertise and knowledge to enhance the quality and efficiency of our work.
